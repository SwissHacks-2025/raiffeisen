# Raiffeisen Agentic Advisor Assistant (AAA)

## Overview
The Raiffeisen Agentic Advisor Assistant (AAA) is designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of Raiffeisen advisors during client interactions. It acts as a multi-functional AI-powered assistant throughout the client journey — from appointment tracking and data management to improving advisory quality. Key features include:

1. **Transcript Summary**  
   AAA records and transcribes client meetings. It then generates concise summaries highlighting the main discussion topics. A keyword search function helps advisors quickly navigate the transcript and pinpoint specific sections.

2. **Data Check**  
   At the end of a session, AAA cross-references client-shared information with existing personal records and suggests updates. The advisor can then easily validate or reject proposed changes.

3. **Representativeness Bias Detection**  
   AAA uses pattern recognition to detect all sort of biases, cognitive, conservative, bias, that may affect the advisor’s decisions or recommendations. It provides feedback to raise awareness and improve future advisory performance.

4. **History Memory**  
   Each client's historical interactions are stored and continuously updated, allowing AAA to offer contextual suggestions, detect changes over time, and assist in continuity across appointments.
