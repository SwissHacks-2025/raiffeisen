So I am sitting here at the SIX headquarter with my dear friend Gerrit Wisthoff and Anne-Meryl de Jong. Wow, amazing. And the fourth Jonathan is currently taking a nap, like all developers should do right now. So we're very proud of him. Gerrit is making a coffee, which is more productive than what Jonathan is doing. I'm speaking shit into the mic right now. The only productive person is Anne. So we're proud of Anne. That's the reason why she got the coffee. That's why I got the first coffee. Exactly. And yeah, I'm looking forward to the afternoon.
